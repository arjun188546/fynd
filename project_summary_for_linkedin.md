Fynd Feed is a full-stack, enterprise-ready customer feedback analysis platform. It leverages cutting-edge Generative AI to transform raw customer reviews into actionable business intelligence.

## 🚀 Core Features

### 1. AI-Powered Feedback Processing

- **Smart Summarization**: Distills long reviews into concise, 1-2 sentence summaries for admin oversight.
- **Actionable Insights**: AI consultants suggest 2-3 specific business improvements based on the sentiment and content of each review.
- **Gibberish Detection**: Custom algorithms to filter out keyboard mashing and meaningless input before processing.

### 2. Intelligent Admin Dashboard ("Ask Fynd AI")
- **RAG-Enabled Chatbot**: An advanced assistant that "reads" all customer feedback and answers complex administrative queries.
- **Quarter-Screen Sidebar**: A spacious, premium UI for deep data exploration.

- **Live Statistics**: Real-time tracking of rating distributions, average scores, and sentiment trends.

### 3. Modern Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion (for smooth animations), and Lucide React icons.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Zod (for robust validation).
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (supporting `gemini-2.0-flash` and `gemini-1.5-flash`).
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for secure, scalable data and user management.
- **Auth**: Secure JWT-based authentication with role-based access control (Admin vs. User).
- **Deployment**: Integrated with GitHub and optimized for cloud services like Render.

## 🎨 Recent UI/UX Enhancements
